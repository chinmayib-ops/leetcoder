# LeetCoding Every Day Until Vacation Ends

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to practicing LeetCode problems daily until the end of my vacation. The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills, master common coding patterns, and prepare for technical interviews through consistent and focused practice.

## Daily Routine

- **Solve 1-5 LeetCode problems every day** (number depends on difficulty and available time).
- Focus on a mix of Easy, Medium, and occasionally Hard problems.
- Prioritize understanding patterns (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, dynamic programming).
- Review and revisit unsolved or tricky problems regularly.
- Take notes and document insights for future reference.

## How I Practice

1. **Pick a Pattern or Topic**
   - Select a topic (e.g., arrays, trees, graphs) or a problem pattern (e.g., two pointers)
2. **Attempt the Problem**
   - Try to solve the problem on my own first.
3. **Study Solutions**
   - If stuck, review the official solution and LeetCode Discuss for alternative approaches
   - Understand the logic deeply; donâ€™t just memorize code.
4. **Implement and Optimize**
   - Write my own solution, then optimize for time and space complexity.
5. **Reflect and Note**
   - Summarize what I learned and add notes/tips for future reference.

## Tracking Progress

- Maintain a daily log in the repository (e.g., `progress.md` or commit messages with problem titles).
- Track solved problems, notes, and revisit dates.
- Optionally, use a spreadsheet or GitHub Projects board for visualization[3].

## Resources

- [LeetCode Patterns](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/)
- Neetcode Roadmap
- Tech Interview Handbook
- LeetCode Discuss section for community solutions
- YouTube explanations for tough problems

## Motivation

Consistent daily practice is the key to improvement in coding interviews and competitive programming. Even an hour a day is more valuable than sporadic, intensive sessions. The aim is to make problem-solving a habit and build confidence through gradual progression.
